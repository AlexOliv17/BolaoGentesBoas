-- Migration: Create Storage Bucket for Avatars
-- Description: Creates the avatars bucket and adds RLS policies for uploading and reading.

-- 1. Create the bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'avatars',
  'avatars',
  true,
  5242880, -- 5MB limit
  ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp']
) ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- 2. Set up RLS Policies

-- Allow public access to read any avatar
CREATE POLICY "Public avatars are viewable by everyone"
  ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
  USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- Allow authenticated users to upload their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatar"
  ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' AND 
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- Allow authenticated users to update their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own avatar"
  ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' AND 
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- Allow authenticated users to delete their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own avatar"
  ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
  USING (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' AND 
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );
